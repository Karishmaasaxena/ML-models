hey ! wanna wonder about machine learning models.
i have worked on different machine learning models 
whether supervised learning and unsupervised learning ,so explore them now

Supervised learning can be used to perform classification or regression tasks. Standard supervised learning algorithms includes:

Decision trees, 
Random forests, 
Logistic regression, 
Support vector machines, 
K-nearest neighbours. 

Supervised learning algorithms can be further divided into two categories depending on the type of output they produce.

Regression Algorithms
Classification Algorithms

Regression Algorithms
Regression algorithms are used to predict a continuous numerical value, such as a house's price or a day's temperature. Different types of regression algorithms exist, such as

Linear Regression, 
Polynomial Regression, 
Lasso Regression,
Ridge regression.
Classification Algorithms
Classification algorithms are used to predict a categorical or discrete value, such as whether an email is spam. Some examples of classification algorithms includes

Decision trees, 
Support vector machines (SVM), 
k-nearest neighbours (KNN).
